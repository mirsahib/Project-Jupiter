# Assignment

**A**. Write a program in which producer process creates a child process, child process takes
input to generate two matrices and put in the shared memory and parent process reads the
matrices in the shared memory and then calculates the product matrix using multiple
threads and stores in the shared memory, a separate client process reads product matrix and
prints on the console.

**B**. Write a program that creates three child processes and three pipes to communicate with each
process. Each child process reads from different serial line and sends the characters read back
to the parent process through a pipe. The parent process outputs all characters received on the
console. A child terminates when two newline characters are received consecutively. The
parent terminates after all three children have terminated. (hint: send-pipe and receive-pipe
primitives can be used)

**C**. The reader writer problem: A number of readers may simultaneously be reading from a file.
Only one writer at a time may write to file, and no reader can be reading while a writer is
writing. Using semaphores, Write solution to the reader writers problem that gives priority
to writers.

**D**. Modify the socket-based date server (Figure 3.21) in Chapter 3 so that the server
services each client request in a separate thread.

**E. Banker’s Algorithm**
For this project, you will write a multithreaded program that implements the banker’s algorithm
discussed in Section 7.5.3. Several customers request and release resources from the bank. The
banker will grant a request only if it leaves the system in a safe state. A request that leaves the
system in an unsafe state will be denied. This programming assignment combines three
separate topics:
(1) multithreading, (2) preventing race conditions, and (3) deadlock avoidance.
<br>**The Banker**
The banker will consider requests from n customers for m resources types. As outlined in
Section 7.5.3. The banker will keep track of the resources using the following data structures:
/* these may be any values >= 0 */
 #define NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS 5
 #define NUMBER OF RESOURCES 3
/* the available amount of each resource */
int available[NUMBER OF RESOURCES];
/*the maximum demand of each customer */
int maximum[NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS][NUMBER OF RESOURCES];
/* the amount currently allocated to each customer */
int allocation[NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS][NUMBER OF RESOURCES];/* the remaining need of each customer */
int need[NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS][NUMBER OF RESOURCES];
<br>**The Customers**
Create n customer threads that request and release resources from the bank. The customers will
continually loop, requesting and then releasing random numbers of resources. The customers’
requests for resources will be bounded by their respective values in the need array. The banker
will grant a request if it satisfies the safety algorithm discussed in the class. If a request does
not leave the system in a safe state, the banker will deny it. Function prototypes for requesting
and releasing resources are as follows:
int request resources(int customer num, int request[]);
int release resources(int customer num, int release[]);
These two functions should return 0 if successful (the request has been granted) and –1 if
unsuccessful. Multiple threads (customers) will concurrently access shared data through these
two functions. Therefore, access must be controlled through mutex locks to prevent race
conditions.
<br>**Implementation**
You should invoke your program by passing the number of resources of each type on the
command line. For example, if there were three resource types, with ten instances of the first
type, five of the second type, and seven of the third type, you would invoke your program
follows:
./a.out 10 5 7
The available array would be initialized to these values. You may initialize the
maximum array (which holds the maximum demand of each customer) using any
method you find convenient .
